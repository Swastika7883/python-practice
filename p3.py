# CHAPTER 2 – PRACTICE SET

#1 Write a python program to add two numbers.

# 2Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.

#3 Check the type of variable assigned using input() function.

#4 Use comparison operator to find out whether a given variable a is greater than ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80.

#5 Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user.

#6 Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.

#1
a = 10
b =20

print ("sum : ",a+b)

#2
z =3
a = int (input("enter a number :"))
result = a%z
print(result)

#3
num = input("enter :")

print(type(num))
